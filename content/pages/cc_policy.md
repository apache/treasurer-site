## ASF Credit Card Policy

</div>

<div class="card-body">

## Purpose

The Apache Software Foundation is a recognized 501(c)(3) charitable foundation whose mission entails using sponsor funds responsibly. The ASF will, from time to time, issue organization credit cards to certain individuals for use in their roles. This policy sets out the acceptable and unacceptable uses of such credit cards.

## Policies

*   Use of ASF-issued credit cards is a privilege, which the ASF may withdraw at any time.
*   Any credit card the ASF issues to an individual must be used for business purposes only, in conjunction with the individual's duties.
*   Expenses need to be appropriate, proportionate and statutory/in accordance with the ASF's bylaws.
*   Expenses must be for approved budget items only. Any items not budgeted or outside what is typically paid for in the cardholder's role must be authorized in advance by the President or Board of Directors.
*   Using the credit card to entertain government officials requires prior approval by the President or Board of Directors.
*   Cash advances on credit cards require prior approval by the President or Board of Directors and usage must be documented, e.g. through receipts.
*   Personal purchases of any type are strictly prohibited.
*   The cardholder is responsible for all charges made to the card and will be held liable for any unauthorized items appearing on the credit card statement.
*   Cardholders are required to sign the "cardholder agreement" indicating they accept these terms. Individuals who do not adhere to these policies risk revocation of their credit card privileges and/or disciplinary action.
*   These terms may change in the future, at which point the cardholder will be notified of the updated policies and asked to acknowledge receipt.
